# My Simple Web Project

This is a small website I made while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What it does
- Shows a welcome message
- Has a button that shows a message when clicked

## Files
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

To run: open index.html in your browser or use Live Server in VS Code.
